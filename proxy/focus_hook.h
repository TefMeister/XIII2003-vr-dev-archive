// Keep-rendering-unfocused hook (0.2.6). XIII.exe's main loop polls
// GetForegroundWindow() every iteration and, when the foreground belongs to
// another process, stops ticking the engine entirely (8 ms sleep-poll loop) --
// freezing presentation and therefore the VR overlay whenever anything steals
// focus. This hook patches user32!GetForegroundWindow in XIII.EXE's IAT only,
// reporting the game's device window while a foreign window is foreground.
//
// Installed only when a VR host or the automation harness is enabled AND
// [VR] KeepRenderingUnfocused=1 (the default); with both off the stock
// behavior is untouched.

// Record the game's device window (from the CreateDevice/Reset hooks). Until
// a window is known the hook reports the truth, so nothing changes before the
